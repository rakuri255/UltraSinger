# UltraSinger

> ‚ö†Ô∏è _This project is still under development!_

UltraSinger is a tool to automatically create UltraStar.txt, midi and notes from music. 
It automatically pitches UltraStar files, adding text and tapping to UltraStar files and creates separate UltraStar karaoke files.
It also can re-pitch current UltraStar files and calculates the possible in-game score.

Multiple AI models are used to extract text from the voice and to determine the pitch.

Please mention UltraSinger in your UltraStar.txt file if you use it. It helps others find this tool, and it helps this tool get improved and maintained.
You should only use it on Creative Commons licensed songs.

## üíª How to use this source code

### Installation

* Install Python 3.10 **(older and newer versions has some breaking changes)**. [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Also install ffmpeg separately with PATH. [Download](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
* Go to folder `install` and run install script for your OS.
  * Choose `GPU` if you have an nvidia CUDA GPU.
  * Choose `CPU` if you don't have an nvidia CUDA GPU.

### Run

* In root folder just run `run_on_windows.bat` or `run_on_linux.sh` to start the app.
* Now you can use the UltraSinger source code with `py UltraSinger.py [opt] [mode] [transcription] [pitcher] [extra]`. See [How to use](#how-to-use) for more information.

## üìñ How to use the App

For standard use, you only need to use [opt]. All other options are optional.

### üé∂ Input

#### Audio (full automatic)

##### Local file

```commandline
-i "input/music.mp3"
```

##### Youtube

```commandline
-i https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc
```

#### UltraStar (re-pitch)

This re-pitch the audio and creates a new txt file.

```commandline
-i "input/ultrastar.txt"
```

### üó£ Transcriber

Keep in mind that while a larger model is more accurate, it also takes longer to transcribe.

#### Whisper

For the first test run, use the `tiny`, to be accurate use the `large-v2` model.

```commandline
-i XYZ --whisper large-v2
```

##### Whisper languages

Currently provided default language models are `en, fr, de, es, it, ja, zh, nl, uk, pt`. 
If the language is not in this list, you need to find a phoneme-based ASR model from 
[ü§ó huggingface model hub](https://huggingface.co). It will download automatically.

Example for romanian:
```commandline
-i XYZ --whisper_align_model "gigant/romanian-wav2vec2"
```

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Hyphenation

Is on by default. Can also be deactivated if hyphenation does not produce 
anything useful. Note that the word is simply split, 
without paying attention to whether the separated word really 
starts at the place or is heard.  

```commandline
-i XYZ --hyphenation True
```

### üëÇ Pitcher

Pitching is done with the `crepe` model.
Also consider that a bigger model is more accurate, but also takes longer to pitch.
For just testing you should use `tiny`.
If you want solid accurate, then use the `full` model.

```commandline
-i XYZ --crepe full
```

### üëÑ Separation

The vocals are separated from the audio before they are passed to the models. If problems occur with this, 
you have the option to disable this function; in which case the original audio file is used instead.

```commandline
-i XYZ --disable_separation True
```

### Format Version

This defines the format version of the UltraStar.txt file. For more info see [Official UltraStar format specification](https://usdx.eu/format/).

You can choose between 3 different format versions. The default is `1.0.0`.
* `0.3.0` is the old format version. Use this if you have problems with the new format.
* `1.0.0` is the current format version.
* `1.1.0` is the upcoming format version. It is not finished yet.

```commandline
-i XYZ --format_version 1.0.0
```

### üèÜ Ultrastar Score Calculation

The score that the singer in the audio would receive will be measured. 
You get 2 scores, simple and accurate. You wonder where the difference is? 
Ultrastar is not interested in pitch hights. As long as it is in the pitch range A-G you get one point. 
This makes sense for the game, because otherwise men don't get points for high female voices and women don't get points 
for low male voices. Accurate is the real tone specified in the txt. I had txt files where the pitch was in a range not 
singable by humans, but you could still reach the 10k points in the game. The accuracy is important here, because from
this MIDI and sheet are created. And you also want to have accurate files


### üìü Use GPU

With a GPU you can speed up the process. Also the quality of the transcription and pitching is better.

You need a cuda device for this to work. Sorry, there is no cuda device for macOS.

It is optional (but recommended) to install the cuda driver for your gpu: see [driver](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
Install torch with cuda separately in your `venv`. See [tourch+cuda](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
Also check you GPU cuda support. See [cuda support](https://gist.github.com/standaloneSA/99788f30466516dbcc00338b36ad5acf)

Command for `pip`:
```
pip3 install torch==2.0.1+cu117 torchvision==0.15.2+cu117 torchaudio==2.0.2+cu117 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```

When you want to use `conda` instead you need a [different installation command](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

#### Considerations for Windows users

The pitch tracker used by UltraSinger (crepe) uses TensorFlow as its backend.
TensorFlow dropped GPU support for Windows for versions >2.10 as you can see in this [release note](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.11.1) and their [installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#windows-native).

For now UltraSinger runs the latest version available that still supports GPUs on windows.

For running later versions of TensorFlow on windows while still taking advantage of GPU support the suggested solution is:

* [install WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
* within the Ubuntu WSL2 installation
  * run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit`
  * follow the setup instructions for UltraSinger at the top of this document

#### Info

If something crashes because of low VRAM then use a smaller model.
Whisper needs more than 8GB VRAM in the `large` model!

You can also force cpu usage with the extra option `--force_cpu`.

#### Docker
to run the docker run `git clone https://github.com/rakuri255/UltraSinger.git`
enter the UltraSinger folder.
run this command to build the docker
`docker build -t ultrasinger .` make sure to include the "." at the end
let this run till complete.
then run this command
`docker run --gpus all -it --name UltraSinger -v  $pwd/src/output:/app/src/output ultrasinger`

Docker-Compose
there are two files that you can pick from.
cd into `docker-compose` folder and then cd into `Nvidia` or `NonGPU`
Run `docker-compose up` to download and setup

Nvidia is for if you have a nvidia gpu to use with UltraSinger.
NonGPU is for if you wish to only use the CPU for UltraSinger.

Output
by default the docker-compose will setup the output folder as `/output` inside the docker.
on the host machine it will map to the folder with the `docker-compose.yml` file under `output`
you may chnage this by editing the `docker-compose.yml`

to edit the file.
use any text editor you wish. i would recoment nano.
run `nano docker-compose.yml`
then change this line
`            -  ./output:/app/UltraSinger/src/output`
to anything you line for on your host machine.
`            -  /yourfolderpathhere:/app/UltraSinger/src/output`
sample
`            -  /mnt/user/appdata/UltraSinger:/output`
note the blank space before the `-`
formating is important here in this file.

this will create and drop you into the docker.
now run this command.
`python3 UltraSinger.py -i file`
or
`python3 UltraSinger.py -i youtube_url`
to use mp3's in the folder you git cloned you must place all songs you like in UltraSinger/src/output.
this will be the place for youtube links aswell.


to quit the docker just type exit.

to reenter docker run this command
`docker start UltraSinger && Docker exec -it UltraSinger /bin/bash`
